  <h3 class="can">Effects of Anti-depressants</h3>
  <p>The real-world effect of using antidepressant medications does not continue to improve patients’ HRQoL over time. Future studies should not only focus on the short-term effect of pharmacotherapy, it should rather investigate the long-term impact of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions on these patients</p>
  <h2 class="can">Stimulants</h2>

  <h3 class="can">Effects of Stimulants</h3>
  <p>Stimulants raise alertness, wakefulness, and energy levels. They also raise blood pressure and heart rate. Strong stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine produce a powerful sense of wellbeing and euphoria which can be very addicting. Over time, stimulant abuse can cause physical and psychological dependence. Many people turn to stimulants as a way to improve their performance. Unfortunately, instead of improving their life, it can create more problems.</p>
  <h2 class="can">Hallucinogens</h2>
  <img src="../img/edu.JPEG" class="image" alt="Hallucinogens">
  <h3 class="can">Effects of Hallucinogens</h3>
  <p>Hallucinogens are drugs that cause users to have altered experiences when under their influence. They are classified in two ways: as classic hallucinogens and as dissociative drugs, per the National Institute on Drug Abuse. They may distort reality and cause users to feel like they are seeing, hearing, or even touching things that aren’t really there.
    Hallucinogens have been popular in the club scene and among youths and college-aged individuals for many years. They are abused most often by individuals who are interested in partying or experimentation, but addiction to hallucinogens is entirely possible. As tolerance takes hold and the dose of the drug needed to get high increases, addiction is already forming.</p>
